# Lessons Learned

## Aaron Wilhite

### Reflect on the project, both technical and organizational. What went well? What didn’t go well?

During Capstone I, organization went very well. As a team we worked together very smoothly and had minimal issues technically. In Capstone II, we had quite a few issues with communication which flowed into our technical and organizational skills. Our team structure was still intact and relatively well organized, but as a team we started to separate and work on our assigned detail designs without discussing these things with each other as often. This caused a significant amount of technical issues in the progress of our project. This then created a snowball effect with technical and organizational issues till around the complete re-scoping at the prototype testing stage.

###  What unanticipated problems occurred?

There were quite a few unanticipated problems that arose. The team and I definitely overestimated the amount of time and resources we would have for the project. This caused us to put forth a lot of effort in areas that we later had to de-scope or re-scope. Ultimately causing us to not be able to even fully implement our initial design.

Another unanticipated issue was understanding how to fully prove that a design would work. As a group we ended up not communicating nearly as well as in Capstone I in this part. This caused us to run into many issues when doing Detail Designs. This also pushed back time we could have been working on the prototype and experimental analysis.

Overall, I would say a majority of our issues as a team were communication related. We could have definitely gotten a lot further if we learned this lesson sooner. Also, we would consistently go through this portion acting like everything was fine, but knowing it was not.

### What would you do differently if you were to do it over again?

I would have rethought the initial problem and our approach to a solution. I think we should have gone completely camera based and not wasted energy and time designing a ground truth system. I also would have put different people in different areas to work on. Lastly, I would have focused on communication way more. This is especially in Capstone II. We had a lot of issues as a team due to this issue, so I would have gone about it completely differently.

### What “best practices” have you identified?

Forming a solid communication method with team members is one best practice I have identified. This is extremely important so the team members can be on the same page with each other at most times.

Learning how to correctly identify an achievable solution is also a best practice I would identify. This is extremely important so the project can actually fully be achieved with a given amount of resources and time.

### What words of wisdom would you pass on to future students?

Communicate with your team members throughout the whole process. Also, continuously emphasize teamwork. Even if you might have your portion of the project designed or working smoothly, it does not mean that everyone else does as well. Everyone needs to work together as a team at all times and check up with each other consistently.

### What new knowledge or skills did you acquire throughout Capstone?

I learned quite a lot throughout Capstone. I learned quite a bit of Python programming with no prior knowledge on it. I learned a lot about wireless communication and computer vision. I also learned cool features and functions with Arduino microcontrollers. I then acquired many new skills like soldering and proving a design to work. I had previously not soldered before due to not doing it at the school that I transferred to Tennessee Tech from or having to do it in any other class. I also improved my programming skills a lot.

On a separate note, I actually learned a lot about teamwork and humility throughout this process. I learned that you really just have to be open to new ideas constantly. This is even in the case that you have completely designed a system and may have to start from scratch.

## Genevieve Schreiber

### Reflect on the project, both technical and organizational. What went well? What didn’t go well?

Organizationally, the team was really well-structured and efficient during Capstone I. In Capstone II, our team became disjointed and uncommunicative. It also became harder to know next steps without meeting often.

The AI and sign ended up being the best for the project, as they were the only ones left in the scope. The project could have been better from the technical standpoint if we had known a budget from the start and had a better idea of what was reasonable and unreasonable. If we had lowered our scope to a proof of concept alone (with 2 cameras) much earlier, such as in the project proposal stage, we could have gotten more done in general because we wouldn’t be designing things that were later deemed unnecessary, like the road tubes.

### What unanticipated problems occurred?

The team definitely over-scoped at first, which led to a lot of hiccups down the line. There was a lot of confusion regarding the budget and what was feasible.

In addition, the communication dissolved pretty quickly in Capstone II. There was a huge lack of collaboration at the beginning of the semester, and it just trickled down and made everything else harder.

### What would you do differently if you were to do it over again?

I would have more meetings, especially in Capstone II to keep each other accountable, I felt like even if someone privately messaged everyone, or if people had accountability partners, or if we just had more team meetings than once a week, then the workflow would have been better. Instead, oftentimes people were waiting on people who didn’t know they were being waited on. I wish we had continued to meet and really dig into detailed designs in the meetings, rather than just get progress reports.

### What “best practices” have you identified?

Host more than once-weekly meetings,especially meetings that are focused on the ECE team specifically. I felt like having giant meetings made it harder to communicate what we actually needed to do.

### What words of wisdom would you pass on to future students?

Meet often, if something isn’t happening, investigate it immediately.

### What new knowledge or skills did you acquire throughout Capstone?

I learned how to utilizeLatex software for beautiful documents, I learned about wireless communication, working with databases, presenting better, researching to the point of proof, and the necessity of teamwork.

## Kester Nucum

### Reflect on the project, both technical and organizational. What went well? What didn’t go well?
On the technical side, the software and in particular the AI model was the strongest part of the project. Having a working model, maybe not at the intended accuracy, for both static and dynamic tracking were great goals that were met. However, due to failure in completing critical designs (such as the power subsystems) or receiving certain components (such as the wireless communication devices), we were not able to deploy any housed cameras in a parking lot.

Not being able to deploy an actual camera in the Bell Hall lot really was due to organizational mistakes made at the end of the first semester and the beginning of the second semester, in which there was a lack of collaboration, accountability, urgency, and support of each other to complete detailed designs. Mistakes were made, deadlines were passed, and the consequences of these kept on snowballing.

### What unanticipated problems occurred?

The biggest unanticipated problem revolved around not being able to complete detailed designs in a timely manner due to a lack of collaboration between teammates, a lack of understanding of what constituted proper detailed design, and even unsuitability to designing a certain system (i.e. it is not a good idea to put a CmpE in charge of power). Detailed designs and ordering is what really tripped us up, and we were not really able to recover after that. A good recovery plan can only work if the entire team is motivated to pick up the slack, though there were many times that we were not all on the same page in trying to recover lost time.

### What would you do differently if you were to do it over again?

I would have taken a step back in our intended vision of what we were hoping to implement the moment we had determined seven cameras were needed to cover the entire Bell Hall and rescoped as the semester had begun. I think one major reason we got so behind and nonurgent was due to being overwhelmed at the possibility of having to implement seven of these systems, and if we had set the bar lower from the beginning and also descoped subsystems such as the road tubes, we could have had a more attainable goal from the beginning that we could be motivated to complete.

I would have also implemented some sort of system to keep each other accountable and collaborative, especially in critical moments when deadlines are approaching.

### What “best practices” have you identified?

Having other people review your work before pushing it up for review ensures that designs and other work meets the quality standards that they are being judged for. Host regular meetings and messages between members to ensure that everyone is on track and on the same page, and that people can step in to help each other when needed.

### What words of wisdom would you pass on to future students?

Start early, and expect things taking much longer than you had anticipated. Murphy’s Law will occur a lot throughout the entire project, so expect the unexpected. Also be sure to keep your communications wide open and keep each other accountable. Communication, flexibility, and motivation are the keys to a successful capstone project.

### What new knowledge or skills did you acquire throughout Capstone?

The ultimate lesson I have learned is that project management is not like a school project that you can try to cram the week or night before. Teamwork and communication are critical to the success of the project, and motivation and accountability of the completion and quality of work is imperative to ensure that the project meets the deadlines and requirements. I learned that projects will take a lot more time and resources than intended, so the scale and cost (both money and time) of projects must not be underestimated but rather overestimated.

On the technical side, I learned how to design my own PC as well as run my first ever computer vision algorithm and understand how that specific algorithm worked under the hood. I also gained more familiarity with Python and LaTeX, as well as learned how to write project documentation. It was also really good to go through the entire engineering design and implementation process and learn the importance of really thinking through designs before even implementing anything to make the right decisions.

### Reflect on the project, both technical and organizational. What went well? What didn’t go well?

Technical
1. In terms of what went well, the AI algorithm and sending/receiving information from the database were the only two things that yielded good results.
2. Most detail designs went very poorly either not being utilized or left incomplete. The sign also did not have a robust design which became prone to errors due to poor soldering and an electrical hazard where the positive terminals of the LEDs are connected together.

Organizational
1. Meetings with the supervisor at the scheduled time were met consistently by all teammates.
2. Coordination with the team to meet and get work done did not go well. Team members consistently had other obligations that did not allow them to work on capstone, and claimed they were not aware of what was going on with some parts of the project which caused delays in work completion.

### Unanticipated Problems

1. The ordering problems encountered in Capstone II were not expected, although it did not play as big of an impact compared to delay in design completion.

### What I Would Have Changed

1. Make the team to meet more often to complete work
2. Peer review work to get things potentially approved quicker
3. Have a more realistic approach on expected deliverables for the project from when the proposal was first started

### Best Practices

1. For a new project, have a more flexible approach to its development as new constraints and issues are identified to avoid sinking large amounts of effort into something that may not be useable due to time or resource limitations
2. Have an agreed upon and enforced method of communication in order to make sure that team members know both what it going on during the project and can consistently meet to complete work

### Recommendations to Future Students

1. Meet as often as possible early in the semester or when there are periods of time when other classes aren’t taking up a large amount of time
2. While meeting as a group as good, don’t feel obligated to make sure all team members have to meet at the same time to get work done (but still make sure other team members not attending stay in the loop) as it will cause you to meet less
3. There is merit to working on detail designs during break between Capstone I & II
4. Don’t be scared to ask your team members or other potential sources for help on the project
5. This class is not an option, it is a requirement

### Acquired Skills

1. Creating documentation using the IEEE format
2. Creating documentation using LaTeX and Overleaf
3. The proposal, conceptual design, detail design, prototype, and experimental analysis process of a project
4. Surface level knowledge on rechargeable batteries
5. Surface level knowledge on solar panels
6. What classifies as electrical analysis of a system
7. Understanding how to scope a project given time and resources
8. The importance of negotiation in the project development process
9. The importance of working together on a task

## Regulo Garza

### Reflect on the project, both technical and organizational. What went well? What didn’t go well?

Technical
1. Regarding to what went well I would say that the sign and the AI side of the project were operational. I would say the sign is the best functioning design of the system as it is the only one that is functioning completely without any inaccuracy. The AI model is still inaccurate so there is some troubleshooting left regarding that system.
2. Regarding what didn’t go well is obviously the power and the communication system either didn’t get finished or weren’t implemented due to ordering issues. The sign also needs safety, cosmetic, and weatherproofing to implement it on the field.

Organizational
1. For the majority of capstone one the team met consistently and cooperated on team assignments. Supervisor meetings also were very consistently attended by members.
2. Capstone two organization was a mess. The team failed to communicate properly. Very few instances occurred when the team would meet together and work on an assignment regarding the project. Conflicting schedules between the team and lack of accountability caused a majority of these issues I believe.

### What unanticipated problems occurred?

1. Team member schedules being very full/confilcting with each others.
2. Ordering issues whether it was placing an order or the component      not arriving on time.

### What would you do differently if you were to do it over again?

1. Set a weekly accountability measure for each team member at the beginning of capstone one.
2. Communicated more with my team members. Whether thats updating them on my current tasks or asking them if they needed help on anything. Also, be more of a leader as I felt that at points that’s what the team was lacking.
3. Set the goal low and build upon that. Our scoping was way too ambitious from the beginning. I believe that is due to naiveness regarding camera systems and the ambition to create an outstanding product.
4. Set a time/date where all team members gathered and worked on project related assignments.
5. Asked supervisor/customer for budget details. We were informed by a NAVSEA employee during the poster presentation that our team had a $1000 budget for our project from them. This could have covered our server price and thus yielded a better product.

### What “best practices” have you identified?

1. Setting up a team discord channel and a team Google drive were some of the best ideas we had. Google drive allowed us to work on documents at the same time and organize documents. Discord allowed us to have an quick method to contact the whole team and have a history of our previous messages.
2. Utilizing team members individual strengths when it came to detail designs. We were late to start using each other but once we did designs began being completed much quicker.
3. Documentation assignments are most efficiently completed with the whole team working on them in person or through a voice chat.

### What words of wisdom would you pass on to future students?

1. Work as a team and utilize each others strengths.
2. Don’t take date based assignments lightly, complete them before the due dates that way there is time to fix issues that will arise.
3. Communicate constantly and set some form of accountability for each team member.
4. When things are not going well, inform your supervisor immediately. Also, if rescoping is believed to be needed.

### What new knowledge or skills did you acquire throughout Capstone?

1. Beginner level knowledge of Latex software.
2. Beginner level knowledge of utilizing Github.
3. Documention in IEEE format.
4. Being assigned a system to create with very little to no prior knowledge about it. I learned a decent amount regarding fluid mechanics, deeper understanding of pressure sensors, and deeper knowledge on camera systems.
5. Presentation skills have improved slightly, it is not my forte to begin with but I can say I feel more comfortable if I had to give more in the future.
6. The importance of reaching out to team members to check if they need help.
