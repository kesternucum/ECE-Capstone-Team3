# Primary Data Acquisition Temporary Casing Detail Design

## Function of the Subsystem
The temporary casing for the cameras will be a minimal design meant to protect the cameras from precipitation. This is due to them only being rated for indoor use.
 
## Constraints
- Must fit one camera per casing (5.1 in x 5.1 in x 4.1 in)
- Must be able to protect cameras from precipitation/waterproof until permanent casing is complete
- Must at least have clear acrylic front and bottom sides to casing
- Must be durable enough to drill/cut through (non-brittle plastic) for mounting of camera to case and for the hose clamp to the case 
- Must have two hose clamps at least 22 inches in length each for each casing (20 inch pole perimeter)

## Mounting Instructions (Reference Figures 1-3)
1. Camera will be mounted in the center of the top of the acrylic case using the mounting hardware that came with the camera.
2. Two slits of equal height and 2 to 4 inches apart will then be made on the lower back side wall (2 inches from bottom wall) of the case with the camera pointing outwards for the first hose clamp to be fed through (See Figure 1).
3. Two more slits will then be made above the slits made in Step 2 (2 inches from top wall).
4. The hose clamps will then be fed through these slits and tightened onto the light post securing the casing.
Note: Make sure to just snuggly hand tighten any hardware and not overtighten 

## Analysis
 
Dayaanee Clear Acrylic Box with Lid chosen for:
1.     Camera Size 
Necessary dimensions of 5.9 x 5.9 x 5.9 inches due to camera needing at least 5.4 in x 5.4 in x 4.1 in giving a 0.5 in x 0.5 in x 1.8 in tolerance.
 
2.     Clarity
This product has a transparent face and bottom which will suit this application for visibility. 
 
3.     Waterproofing
This box does not claim to be waterproof, but this is not an issue due to waterproofing it being as simple as putting Henkel Clear Silicone Waterproof Sealant on each connecting interior edge [2].
 
4.     Durability
This product is made of acrylic, and acrylic meets the requirements of being able to drill through for mounting the camera and cutting for the hose clamp to feed through[1]. 

5.     Mounting
The mounting hardware provided with the cameras will be used to mount the cameras to the interior top side of the casing.

The Steelsoft Hose clamps were chosen due to being:
- Stainless Steel (Weather Resistant)
- Meets the constraint of being at least 22 inches per clamp due to being cuttable to size.
