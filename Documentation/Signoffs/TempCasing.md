# Primary Data Acquisition Temporary Casing Detail Design

## Function of the Subsystem
The temporary casing for the cameras will be a minimal design meant to protect the cameras from precipitation. This is due to them only being rated for indoor use.
 
## Constraints
- Must fit one camera per casing (5.1 in x 5.1 in x 4.1 in)
- Must be able to protect cameras from precipitation/waterproof until permanent casing is complete
- Must at least have clear acrylic front and bottom sides to casing
- Must be durable enough to drill/cut through (non-brittle plastic) for mounting of camera to case and for the hose clamp to the case

## Analysis
 
Dayaanee Clear Acrylic Box with Lid chosen for:
1.     Camera Size 
Necessary dimensions of 5.9 x 5.9 x 5.9 inches due to camera needing at least 5.4 in x 5.4 in x 4.1 in giving a 0.5 in x 0.5 in x 1.8 in tolerance.
 
2.     Clarity
This product has a transparent face and bottom which will suit this application for visibility. 
 
3.     Waterproofing
This box does not claim to be waterproof, but this is not an issue due to waterproofing it being as simple as putting Henkel Clear Silicone Waterproof Sealant on each connecting interior edge [2].
 
4.     Durability
This product is made of acrylic, and acrylic meets the requirements of being able to drill through for mounting the camera and cutting for the hose clamp to feed through[1].
