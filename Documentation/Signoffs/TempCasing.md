## Analysis

The idea of creating a clear acrylic box as a temporary casing came to light. After some research it became apparent that purchasing premade boxes and reinforcing them with silicon on the seams would be the best option due to budget. 
	
*Camera Size 

The diameter of the mounting surface is 5.4 inches and the height of the camera is 4.1 inches. Therefore, the minimum dimensions of the box would be 5.4 x 5.4 x 4.1 inches. Yet, a tolerance of at least +0.5 inches would be necessary for ease of mounting and maneuverability. A clear box with dimensions of 5.9 x 5.9 x 5.9 inches was then found which meets this tolerance [1].

*Clarity

The plastic box found also has a clear face and bottom which will suit this application for visibility. 

*Waterproofing

This box does not claim to be waterproof, but this is not an issue due to waterproofing it being as simple as putting silicon on each connecting interior edge [2].

*Durability

It must be strong enough to drill through. Acrylic meets these requirements and this product is made from acrylic[1].
