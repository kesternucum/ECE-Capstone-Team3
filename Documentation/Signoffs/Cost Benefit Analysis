Costs Benefits Analysis of the Secondary Acquisition System

The secondary acquisition system's purpose is to act as the ground truth for the primary acquisition system. A ground truth system is one that acts as the reference point to another system. The reference point we are comparing in our system is the “vehicle count” inside the lot.



1. Costs

Implementation Costs



* Currently, the cost to build three pneumatic road tube systems is $650.00. This is roughly $217.00 dollars per system.
* Integration with other systems
* Personnel wages during the setup of the secondary acquisition system to verify the ground truth reference point is correct.
    * The verification method would require a visual count of the vehicles inside the parking lot to match the count from the secondary acquisition system.

Ongoing Costs



* Maintenance due to tube rips or tears.
    * The road tubes are the most costly part of the secondary acquisition system. A 100-foot roll is $117.00. Given that each point of detection has two rows of tubes lined out, the roll might be consumed quickly.
    * They are also the component that will receive the most abuse in the system and are susceptible to being damaged often.
* Facilities technician man hours
    * Tech or customers would spend money paying their facilities maintenance men to replace the ripped tube.
* Personnel wages for daily verification of ground truth reference point.
    * Daily verification would be needed to ensure that the system is operating correctly on a consistent basis.
2. Benefits

Cost Benefits



* A ground truth reference point would be available.
    * Removing the secondary acquisition system would require the same visual count as having the secondary acquisition system would.
        * It is important to note that this visual count would be necessary after the initial setup of the primary acquisition system and after any system failures.
* Integrating the tubes would increase the redundancy in vehicle counting and could potentially mean a “safer” system.
    * Removing the road tubes would lessen the complexity of the overall system, which is already saturated with different methods of counting vehicles. Two of which are counting vehicles entering and exiting the parking lot (dynamic tracking/road tubes).
