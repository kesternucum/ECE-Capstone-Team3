# Parking Lot Monitoring System

## Executive Summary

Commuter students at Tennessee Technological University in Cookeville, TN, frequently face difficulties to find open parking spots in lots during peak hours of the school day, which causes tardiness to class to be a common occurrence. Commuters typically have a lack of foreknowledge of the availability of parking spots across lots prior to entering campus. Due to current products on the market either being very expensive or not fully feasible or effective for Tennessee Tech’s parking lots, an in-house parking lot monitoring system designed by students in Tennessee Tech’s College of Engineering was proposed to provide a more cost-effective solution. A parking lot monitoring system has been designed to utilize sensor technology to track and frequently update the number of available parking spots so that students can know the occupancy of a parking lot in real-time. The data from the sensor technology would be displayed on a mobile application that students can download to view real-time statistics and previous history of parking lot occupancy, as well as on a ground-level display board. This project involves interdisciplinary collaboration between teams from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Department of Computer Science while under the direction of the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) in Dahlgren, VA.

## Capabilities

As a proof of concept, this project is focused on implementing a Parking Lot Monitoring System to track the number of available parking spots in the Red lot behind Bell Hall. The goals for the capabilities of this system are:
  * Utilize computer vision AI to determine the number of available parking spots from images that are sent from cameras installed around the Bell Hall lot
  * Track the number of cars inside the Bell Hall lot using pneumatic road tubes for validation of the measurements from the cameras and computer vision
  * Display the number of available parking spots on a mobile application that students can use
  * Display the number of available parking spots on a sign (similar to those at airport parking lots)

## Salient Outcomes

The most important outcomes of this project will be added here once the Parking Lot Monitoring System project has been implemented and tested.

## Project Demonstration & Images

A demonstration video and images of the project will be added here once the system has been implemented and tested.

## About Us

### Team

**Kester Nucum** is a senior Computer Engineering major at Tennessee Technological University with double minors in Music Performance and Honors. Kester's interests in Electrical and Computer Engineering include artificial intelligence, digital signal processing, and applications in radar and RF technology. He has spent two summers as an intern at Dynetics in Huntsville, AL, where he worked in modeling and simulation of foreign weapons threat systems, and he plans to obtain a Master's Degree in ECE prior to starting a career in the defense industry. For the Parking Lot Monitoring System project, Kester will be primarily focusing on the cameras in the primary data acquisition system, the hardware for the server, and the computer vision AI software. Outside of classes, Kester serves as the President of the Tennessee Gamma chapter of Tau Beta Pi, plays violin in the University Orchestra, and is active in University Catholic.

**Aaron Wilhite** is a senior Electrical Engineering major at Tennessee Technological University with a minor in Math. He spent the previous year at a co-op with EOSYS in Smyrna, TN doing custom system integration. During this co-op he gained experience in HMI design and PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) programming. For the Parking Lot Monitoring System project, Aaron will be primarily focusing on the sign subsystem. Outside of classes, Aaron spends most of his time rock climbing and camping.

**Gabriel Laboy** is a senior Computer Engineering major with a minor in Computer Science at Tennessee Technological University. His interests include digital systems, virtual reality (VR), and cyber security. He spent a whole year as a co-op at EOSYS located in Smyrna, TN, and later plans to pursue a Master's Degree in Computer Science in hopes of being a professor of university. Gabriel's role in the project will be working on the power for the primary data acquisition system and collaboration with the Computer Science (CSC) team to ensure successful operation of the mobile application with the server. He is also currently serving as the Vice Chair of the student chapter of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), and will serve as the Recording Secretary of the Tennessee Gamma chapter of Tau Beta Pi in the spring.

**Genevieve Schreiber** is a senior Computer Engineering major at Tennessee Technological University with a minor in Mathematics. Her interests involve FPGAs, embedded systems, and space. She has spent 1 year interning at ALTEN as a software intern working in embedded systems. She plans to work in space-adjacent fields post-graduation. For this Parking Lot Monitoring System, Genevieve will be primarily focused on the networks involved between the many devices used. She is also part of the Omega Phi Alpha national service sorority.

**Reggie Garza** is a senior electrical engineering major at Tennessee Tech University. Reggie's interest include robotics and automation. He has spent the last two years interning at ATC Automation in Cookeville,TN. There he has been part of a team of engineers and has contributed with the electrical design and programming of several machines. Reggie will be helping design the primary acquisition system and the secondary acquisition system.

### Faculty Supervisor

**Jesse Roberts** is a Lecturer in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Tennessee Technological University. He received both his Bachelor's and Master's Degrees in Electrical Engineering from Tennessee Tech, and he is currently working on obtaining his Doctorate of Philosophy in Computer Science from Vanderbilt University, anticipated May 2023. He is the instructor for the ECE 4961 Capstone I and ECE 4971 Capstone II courses at Tennessee Tech, and he serves as the faculty supervisor for the Parking Lot Monitoring System project. His research interests include Game Theory and Mechanism Design, Graph and Learning Theory, Spiking Neural Networks, Computational Sustainability, Computational Creativity and Criticism, and Automation. In his free time, Jesse loves to go rock climbing.

### Stakeholders

The **Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division** in Dahlgren, VA, under the Naval Sea Systems Command, more commonly referred to as **NAVSEA**, is the primary customer of this project. The NSWC Dahlgren Site is a premier research and development center that serves as a specialty site for weapon system integration. Engineers and scientists focus on providing research, development, test and evaluation, analysis, systems engineering, integration, and certification of complex naval warfare systems related to surface warfare and strategic systems. NAVSEA engineers, builds, buys and maintains the ships, submarines, carriers (unmanned systems) and combat systems that patrol the oceans and secure American shores.

The major stakeholder that will be affected by this project are the **commuter students** of Tennessee Tech since this project is designed with them in mind. We hope that this project will help commuter students (students who drive to campus and possess a Red parking pass) plan out their parking routines more effectively and also know of alternate spots to park on campus, albeit if those spots are more inconvenient/out of the way.

Another major stakeholder is **Tennessee Tech** itself because the data collected from this system--the parking history of lots throughout the day--can be potentially used for future planning and zoning purposes. This data can prove to be valuable in collecting data about student parking behaviors since campus parking is an evergreen problem that persists at Tennessee Tech.
